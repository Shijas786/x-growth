1. i got tired of missing good crypto job listings

so i vibe coded a simple aggregator: all web3 jobs, all in one site.

would love feedback from job hunters + founders hiring 

[ link is under the comments ]

2. i used to watch youtube all night just to pass my exams.

now? you can upload a hard test paper to ai. it explains things so clearly that even a 10yr old would understand.

but rn, ppl act like ai is just for "vibe coding." we don’t need another habit tracker app that no one

3. yayy, very good that you’re doing experiment on this. 

are you done now?

finally fixed my vitamin D levels 

if you’re an indoor person and feel this ↓
